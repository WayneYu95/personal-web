- As one of the IEEE team leaders at Buffalo State, my duty is to manage the funding and estimate the amount of money required for each project or activity.
- As a professional electrical engineering student organization, we will contact local engineering companies and lead students to visit these companies so that they can have a clear understanding of their future career direction.
